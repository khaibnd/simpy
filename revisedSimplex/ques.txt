//The question format should be like this and comments
//are given by these.The objective function is given by
//[obj] parameter and consists of a list of the coefficients
//in order x1,x2.Each command should be on separate lines
//and for each parameter open there should be a close of that
//parameter like [!obj].Be careful of the spacing i.e
//always one space in between options.
#[obj]
